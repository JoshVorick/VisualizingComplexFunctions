VisualizingComplexFunctions
===========================

Currently this just has the functionality of interactively displaying the Mandelbrot Set, Julia Sets, and variations.
The mandelbrot and Julia fractals are generated by the iterative equation f(z) = z^2 + c. By clicking on the Mandelbrot Set, you change the value of C, which affects the shape of the Julia Set. By clicking on the Julia Set, you change the initial value of z, which in turn changes the shape of the Mandelbrot Set (which technically makes it not _the_ Mandelbrot Set any more). 

All the controls are printed in the terminal you run the program from.

Right now, it crashes if the 'correct' size isn't hard coded in correctly. To get around this run it once and write down the dimensions it tells you immediately before crashing, then go into the code and edit line 432 to be the dimensions you wrote down and then recompile and run!

To be added:
- Save images as .png using libPNG. This way you can save any cool images you create as an arbitralily large image! (1920x1080 will be default)
- Draw non-iterative complex functions with multiple, cool color schemes.
- Do something similar in Go, Mathematica, and Haskell!
